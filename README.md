The research examines the improvement in the transparency of the credit scoring by utilizing explainable machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies. Traditional credit scoring procedures are not always clear, and lending decisions are usually made in such a way that they are hard to explain. To overcome this, the study borrows real-life data of 100,000 records, 23 features of demographic, financial and behavioural data to create predictive models to classify the credit score into poor, standard and good. Preprocessing of initial data included the treatment of the large amounts of missing data, i.e., Monthly_Inhand_Salary (15,002 missing) and Type_of_Loan (11,408 missing), and eliminating extreme outliers in some features, e.g., Num_Credit_Card (up to 1,400 cards). Basic engineering of features was done, so a Total_Accounts feature was created, and the Credit_History_Age feature was converted into months.
Several algorithms based on machine learning, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, have been trained and tested. The Random Forest model performed the best with 78.39% accuracy, F1-score 0.78 and balanced class-wise recall, which made a significant increase in identifying the underrepresented minority: the Good class (Recall: 0.67). Although XAI methods such as SHAP and LIME yielded interpretable explanations, all three features, Delay_from_due_date, Monthly_Balance and Credit_History_Age, were indicated as the most significant predictors.
These results indicate that ensemble models produce better predictive accuracy and are also explainable with XAI, allowing them to be remarked transparently and accountable when determining credit risk. The study would add a strong framework of interpretable credit scoring, which would balance model performance and interpretability and provide practical advice to financial institutions willing to find a data-driven tool for decision-making.
